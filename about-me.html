   <p >  My name is Asadullah Hanif. I am a proud father of two wonderful children, Oswah and Mansoor. With a deep passion for cities, communities, and development, I have devoted my career to urban planning, humanitarian assistance, and academic research. I hold a Ph.D. in Urban Planning, and my journey has taken me through academia, international development organizations, and the United Nations system. </p>
   <h3>Professional Background</h3>
   <p>I have been serving as a university lecturer for several years, teaching and mentoring students in urban planning and related fields. My academic work is focused on promoting sustainable urban development, spatial planning, and community-driven solutions. </p>
   <p>Previously, I worked with UN-Habitat as an Urban Planning Specialist for over four years. During this time, I played a key role in formulating the Strategic Action Plans for Herat and InjilMunicipalities, which were designed to guide local development and enhance urban governance.
    Currently, I am working with the United Nations as a Program Analyst for Humanitarian Interventions. In this role, I monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of humanitarian programs, ensuring they respond effectively to the needs of affected communities and contribute to long-term resilience.</p>
   <h3>Research and Publications</h3>
   <p> One of my proudest achievements is contributing to research in the field of urban planning within the Afghan context. My work has resulted in several published research papers that focus on sustainable urban development, governance, and planning strategies in Afghanistan which is accessible from the following<strong> links:</strong></p>
